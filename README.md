# Avoid annoying users with a click of a button
Make [csfd.cz](https://csfd.cz) a better place for yourself

## Why?

Let's be honest: a lot of those who post reviews or comment on this website are one of these kinds of people:

![csfd_blocker_banner](https://github.com/HynekS/csfd-blocker/assets/24924967/50dbec7e-d8c2-49d6-8c26-56e947536bd5)

They might be offensive, boring, or just plain annoying. This extension gives you an opportunity to avoid them completely. You can make your time on this website much more enjoyable!

## How?

*   Install this extension,
*   Block,
*   $$$.

## But seriously, How?!

Don't worry. It's really simple.

1. First, install the extension from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/csfd%20blocker?hl=cs).

2. After the installation, you'll find three tiny dots in the top right corner of the "review" or "comment" box

3. Clicking those dots will expand a menu with a single option: "Block user XY." Click on it.

4. The user is now blocked. You can unblock him using the same menu that will appear if you click on the show post button.
    

## Looks cool! What else can it do?

To easily manage the list of blocked users, or to add users without searching for their posts, you can use the _Popup_. It can be activated by clicking the extension icon right next to the address bar.
